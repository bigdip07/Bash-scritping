
# The `for` Loop in Bash Scripting

## Introduction
A `for` loop is a Bash programming language statement that allows code to be repeatedly executed. It is classified as an iteration statement, meaning it involves the repetition of a process within a Bash script. For example, you can run a UNIX command or task multiple times or read and process a list of files using a `for` loop.

## Basic Structure
The basic structure of a `for` loop in Bash is as follows:
```bash
for item in list
do
    command1 on $item
    command2
    ...
    commandN
done
```

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for item in tomato maggi soap
do
    echo "Item: $item"
done
```

## Advanced Usage of `for` Loops

### Iterating Over a List of Items
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for item in tomato maggi soap
do
    echo "Item: $item"
done
```

### Iterating Over a List of Files
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in file1 file2 file3
do
    echo "Processing $file"
    # Perform commands on $file
done
```

### Iterating Over Command Output
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for output in $(ls /path/to/directory)
do
    echo "File: $output"
    # Perform commands on $output
done
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Creating Multiple Users
**Scenario:** A system administrator needs to create multiple user accounts for a new batch of employees.

#### Script: `create_users.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to create multiple users

for user in u6bt u7bt u8bt u9bt
do 
    useradd ${user}
    echo "User $user is successfully created"
    sleep 3
done
```

### Example 2: Creating Users from a File
**Scenario:** Usernames are stored in a file, and the script reads from this file to create user accounts.

#### Script: `create_users_from_file.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to create users from a file

for user in $(cat user_list.txt)
do 
    useradd ${user}
    echo "User $user is successfully created"
    sleep 3
done
```

### Example 3: Deleting Multiple Users
**Scenario:** A system administrator needs to delete multiple user accounts listed in a file.

#### Script: `delete_users_from_file.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to delete users from a file

for user in $(cat user_list.txt)
do 
    userdel ${user}
    echo "User $user was successfully deleted"
    sleep 3
done
```

### Example 4: Installing Multiple Packages
**Scenario:** A new project requires several specific software packages to be installed on all development machines.

#### Script: `install_packages.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to install multiple packages

PKGS="php7-openssl-7.3.19-r0 php7-common-7.3.19-r0 php7-fpm-7.3.19-r0 php7-opcache-7.3.19-r0 php7-7.3.19-r0"
for pkg in $PKGS
do
   echo "Installing $pkg package"
   apt install "$pkg" -y
done
```

### Example 5: Removing Multiple Packages
**Scenario:** Uninstalling several software packages that are no longer needed.

#### Script: `remove_packages.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to remove multiple packages

PKGS="php7-openssl-7.3.19-r0 php7-common-7.3.19-r0 php7-fpm-7.3.19-r0 php7-opcache-7.3.19-r0 php7-7.3.19-r0"
for pkg in $PKGS
do
   echo "Removing $pkg package"
   apt remove "$pkg" -y
done
```

### Example 6: Printing Multiplication Table
**Scenario:** A script to print the multiplication table of a given number.

#### Script: `multiplication_table.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to print multiplication table of a given number
# Version: 1.0
# Date: 07/28/2021

echo "What is your value: "
read value
i=1
while [ $i -le 10 ]
do
    result=$((value * i))
    echo "$value * $i = $result"
    i=$((i+1))
done
```

## Real-Life Case Studies

### Case Study 1: User Account Management
**Scenario:** Automating the creation of user accounts for a new batch of employees, ensuring each account is properly set up with initial configurations.

#### Script: `create_users.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to create multiple users

for user in u6bt u7bt u8bt u9bt
do 
    useradd ${user}
    echo "User $user is successfully created"
    sleep 3
done
```

### Case Study 2: Processing Log Files
**Scenario:** A DevOps engineer needs to process log files generated by various services, extracting relevant information and generating a summary report.

#### Script: `process_logs.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to process log files

LOG_DIR="/var/log/myapp"
for log_file in $(ls $LOG_DIR/*.log)
do
    echo "Processing $log_file"
    grep "ERROR" $log_file > ${log_file}.errors
    echo "Errors extracted to ${log_file}.errors"
done
```

### Case Study 3: Deploying Updates
**Scenario:** A software deployment script needs to update several servers with the latest version of an application.

#### Script: `deploy_updates.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to deploy updates to multiple servers

SERVERS="server1.example.com server2.example.com server3.example.com"
for server in $SERVERS
do
    echo "Updating $server"
    ssh $server 'sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y'
    echo "$server updated successfully"
done
```

### Case Study 4: Automating Backups
**Scenario:** A system administrator needs to automate the backup of important configuration files.

#### Script: `backup_configs.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Description: Script to backup configuration files

CONFIG_FILES="/etc/nginx/nginx.conf /etc/mysql/my.cnf /etc/php/7.3/fpm/php.ini"
BACKUP_DIR="/backup/configs"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DIR

for file in $CONFIG_FILES
do
    echo "Backing up $file"
    cp $file $BACKUP_DIR
done
```

## Summary
The `for` loop in Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks. It can be used to iterate over lists of items, files, command outputs, and more. By mastering `for` loops, you can write more efficient and concise scripts to perform a variety of tasks.
