## Introduction to Bash Scripting

Learn the basics of Bash, a command language interpreter, and understand basic commands to get started with Bash scripting.

## Variables in Bash Scripting

Understand how to set and use variables in Bash, including environment variables, and see examples of their usage.

## If Statements in Bash Scripting

Learn how to use `if` statements to make decisions in your Bash scripts, with examples of basic conditions and file existence checks.

## For Loop in Bash Scripting

Explore the `for` loop in Bash to execute commands repeatedly over a list of items, with practical examples.

## While Loop in Bash Scripting

Understand the `while` loop to execute commands repeatedly until a specified condition occurs, with examples including file reading and system monitoring.

## Functions in Bash Scripting

Learn how to define and use functions in Bash to encapsulate and reuse code, with examples of parameters, return values, and nested functions.

## Using `awk` for Text Processing

Discover the `awk` command for pattern scanning and processing, with examples of printing fields, using custom separators, and generating reports.

## Using `sed` for Text Manipulation

Explore the `sed` stream editor for filtering and transforming text, with examples of text replacement, line deletion, and configuration file modification.

## Exit Codes and Command Substitution

Understand how to check exit codes to determine command success and use command substitution to capture command output in Bash.

## Project: System Administration Toolkit

A practical project that combines the concepts learned in the tutorial to create a set of scripts for user management, log monitoring, disk usage reporting, and backup creation.
